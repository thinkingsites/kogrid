<h1>Manual Rows</h1>
<p>In this example, we're taking a javascript data and passing it into the grid directly via the rows property without the use of ajax.  This method is mutually exclusive to using the ajax grid and cannot be changed once a grid has been implemented.</p>
<div data-bind="kogrid : $data"></div>
